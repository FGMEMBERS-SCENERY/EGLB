# EGLB
EGLB Brooklands. Vickers and Hawkers aircraft works and airfield, aproximately 1930, built on site of Brooklands car race track.

There are many histories of the car race track and the aircraft factory on the Internet - e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklands


Flying notes.

The main grass area is smooth and aircraft may land or take off in any clear space. The rough ground on the west side of the airfield and to the north of the flying club is a sewage farm, and is best avoided. 
 
Circuits are to the NW of the airfield to avoid upsetting the rich residents of St Georges Hill.

There are no landing aids. Visual signals from the flying club control aircraft movements. At a later date I will produce a signals area in front of the flying club which will display the standard RAF visual signals.  

Just over 1 mile to the south is the Vickers flight test centre at Wisley. The runway (10/28) is nearly twice as long 6200ft (1900m). Wisley airfield is also included in this package. It is based, with permission, on the FS2004 airfield by Toby Vickers. As WisleyÂ´s original ICAO code has been reallocated, the ICAO code X2WY is used.


Installation

Make a directory for your local scenery. On my system this is C:\Flightgear\MyScenery.

Copy all files and directories from the EGLB directory into this local scenery directory.

Add the local scenery directory to your Flightgear start options  e.g. :-
 
 --fg-scenery=C:\FlightGear\MyScenery
 
 As this airfirld shares the same identification and geographical space as my post-war EGLB package only one or the may be referenced in the Flightgear scenery path.
