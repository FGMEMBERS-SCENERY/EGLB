# EGLB
EGLB Brooklands. Vickers/BAC aircraft factory and airfield, 1960-1970, built on site of pre-war Brooklands car race track.

There are mnay histories of the car race track and the aircraft factory on the Internet - e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklands

This model is of the site in the 1960´s and 70´s. It includes most of the buildings, roads and other features that were present at that time.

Flying notes.

Due to the size of the site, the runway is short 3750ft (1142m).

The runway was not built until 1951. Prior to that a grass strip was used. Apart from the TSR2, maiden flights of all aircraft completed by Vickers and BAC at Weybridge were made from this runway. Aircaft requiring major work would land here. This included the VC10. Large aircraft such as this could only fly in and out with minimum fuel and no payload.

A large gap was cut into the southern banking to give additional clearance for the Valiant V-bomber on its maiden flight.
 
Take off is to the south (runway 19) and landing is to north (runway 01). This is to avoid the London Portsmouth railway which is on an embankement at the NW boundary. It also keeps traffic away from the Heathrow treminal area. Circuits are to the NW to avoid upsetting the rich residents of St Georges Hill.

To extend the take-off run large aircaft would start on the runway extension. 3 blast deflectors are sited here to protect the railway line. 

A marker strip was painted accross the runway near its mid point. This was the point of no-return for the VC10. If the wheels had not lifted by this point there was still sufficient runway left for braking. 

There are no landing aids. Radio was by arrangement with the aircraft factory.

Just over 1 mile to the south is the Vickers BAC flight test centre at Wisley. The runway (10/28) is nearly twice as long 6200ft (1900m). Wisley airfield is also included in this package. It is based, with permission, on the FS2004 airfield by Toby Vickers. As Wisley´s original ICAO code has been reallocated, the ICAO code X2WY is used.


Installation

Make a directory for your local scenery. On my system this is C:\Flightgear\MyScenery.

Copy all files and directories from the EGLB directory into this local scenery directory.

Add the local scenery directory to your Flightgear start options  e.g. :-
 
 --fg-scenery=C:\FlightGear\MyScenery
